# The simple version of PPCA-raytracer

This version is simply translated from c++ code from [_Ray Tracing in One Weekend_](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html)
The original idea of using this as a PPCA project comes from [@skyzh](https://github.com/skyzh)
The output pictures of the check points is included in the [output](https://github.com/Danny2003/rt_simple/tree/master/output) dictionary.
