# The simple version of PPCA-raytracer

- This version is simply translated from c++ code from [_Ray Tracing in One Weekend_](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) and [_Ray Tracing: The Next Week_](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingTheNextWeek.html)
- The original idea of using this as a PPCA project comes from [@skyzh](https://github.com/skyzh)
- Part of some output pictures of the check points is included in the [output](https://github.com/Danny2003/rt_simple/tree/master/output) dictionary.
  However, to avoid cheating, the complete version of check point pictures are not included in this dictionary.
